# econ-570-final-project

Final project for Econ 570 Fundamentals of Data Analytics for Economists at UW-Madison. My group examined arrest rates for marijuana related offenses in Washington D.C., Colorado, California, and at a national level before and after each state passed laws legalizing the recreational use of the drug. This repository includes my contributions (I examined Washington D.C.) as well as the final report.
